          <p class="recipe-description">Dogs can benefit from swimming as it provides an excellent 
            low-impact form of exercise that helps maintain their cardiovascular health and muscle 
            strength while reducing stress on joints. Additionally, swimming can be a fun and refreshing activity, 
            especially in hot weather, promoting both physical and mental well-being in dogs.</p>

          <p class="recipe-description">Dogs should run regularly as it is a natural and instinctual 
            behavior that helps them expend energy, maintain a healthy weight, and promote cardiovascular 
            health. Running also stimulates their mind, enhances overall well-being, and fosters a strong 
            bond with their owners during shared exercise activities.</p>

          <p class="recipe-description">Dogs can benefit from weightlifting exercises when performed under 
            proper guidance and supervision. Weightlifting helps to build muscle strength, improve overall 
            fitness, and promote joint health in dogs, contributing to their overall physical well-being 
            and enhancing athletic performance in certain dog sports and activities. However, it is essential 
            to consult with a veterinarian to ensure that your dog isn't a weakling that'll buckle under the pressure. Get swole nerd.</p>
